        <h1><strong>Why choose ABC software?</strong></h1>
        <p id="infotext">There is a lot of investment going into software engineering at the moment due to
            the increasing reliance on mobile technology, venture capital-backed start-ups, 
            the growing complexity of technology, and emerging industries. The demand for 
            skilled and qualified software engineers seems to have no end. 
            This demand is strengthened by a changing economic landscape and fueled by 
            the need for technology solutions. With billions of physical devices around 
            the world that are now connected to the internet and that are collecting and sharing data,
            all industries are quickly becoming technology driven industries.</p>
